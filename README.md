# My Visual Studio Code IDE Settings

`settings.json` and `keybindings.json` are used to custumize the [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You can use it by replacing the existing ones. In **macOS** the files are located under _\$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json_. In **Linux** they are under _\$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json_.

# List of all extensions I use

Check the *my-vscode-extensions.txt* file for a list of all extensions that I am currently using.

**Batch install**: If you have the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) installed you can batch install a list of extensions by providing them to [this install function](https://github.com/al-soup/my-fish-functions/blob/master/vscodeinstall.fish). Create your own file (`code --list-extensions > my-vscode-extensions.txt`) or use the list of my extensions provided in this repo. Run `vscodeinstall my-vscode-extensions.txt`.
